<h4>DiverSim - A simulation of a Haldane Decompression Model</h4>
</center>

<p>This page contains a simulation of a Haldane Decompression model. This theory states that when a human breathes compressed air, a partial pressure of nitrogen proportional to the ambient pressure is delivered through the lungs into the blood stream. In turn, their body tissues gradually adapt to contain a partial pressure of nitrogen equivalent to that being delivered to them by the bloodstream.</p>

<p>The speed at which nitrogen is absorbed or released depends on the type of tissue nitrogen is in contact with (fat, bone etc.) and the actual blood supply to that part of the body. To account for this, Haldane devised "tissue compartments" and assigned values to each of these theoretical tissues as an indication of how fast they will equalise (or saturate) with the ambient partial pressure of nitrogen being breathed. How "fast" or "slow" tissues are is described in terms of their "halftime". So asumming a static ambient pressure, a tissue with a halftime of 5 minutes will move half way from its current nitrogen uptake to that of the ambient pressure in 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Haldane proposed that if the partial pressure of nitrogen absorbed in any body tissue is greater than twice that of the ambient pressure, the amount of nitrogen being released into the bloodstream is so high it forms bubbles. These bubbles are the cause of decompression sickness.</p>

<p>The program below lets you change the diver's depth by pressing the up and down arrows on your keyboard. In the lower pane, a representation of how much nitrogen is present in each of the theoretical tissue compartments is displayed. When a compartment has greater than twice the ambient partial pressure of nitrogen it is displayed in Red.</p>

<p>NOTE: This simulation cannot be used for real dive planning!</p>
